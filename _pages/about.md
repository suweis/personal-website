I'm Leonardo Pacciani Mori /leo&#39;nardo pa&#39;t͡ʃani &#39;mɔːri/, a PhD student in Physics at the University of Padova. I work in the [LiPh lab](http://liphlab.netlify.com/) under the supervision of Prof. Amos Maritan.

I work in the broad field of biological physics: I use methods and approaches characteristic of statistical physics to create models of biological and living systems.<br>
My current main research interest is the study of how competition influences and drives biodiversity in microbial communities, with a particular focus on understanding the origin of the outstanding biodiversity observed in nature.
