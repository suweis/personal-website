I'm Leonardo Pacciani Mori, a PhD student in Physics at the University of Padova. I work in the [LiPh lab](http://www.pd.infn.it/~maritan/index.html) under the supervision of Prof. Amos Maritan.

[LiPh lab new website](http://sad-turing-8f0389.netlify.com/) (work in progress).

This site is still a work in progress, so some pages could be incomplete.
