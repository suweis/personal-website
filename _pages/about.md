My name is Samir Suweis, I was born in Italy, from a Jordianan father (Simon) and an Italian mother (Alessandra). I grew up in Padova, and my passion for Physics and Matehamtics started during the high school. I've decided to become a Physicist after I've read this [book](https://www.amazon.it/Solo-stupore-conosce-Lavventura-scientifica-ebook/dp/B008HRM9KW/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1535061995&sr=1-1&keywords=Solo+lo+stupore+conosce), collecting experiences, reflections and citations of the greatest scientists and physicists. I'm very eclectic, also loving phylosophy, neuroscience, art, ... in one word I'm a curios truth seeker.


I have obtained both Bachelor and Master degree in Theoretical Physics at the University of Padova. The final Master thesis consisted of a theoretical work on a subject at the boundary between statistical physics and ecological systems, performed under the guidance of prof. Amos Maritan. I then soon started a Ph.D in Environmental Engineering at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) under the supervision of prof. Andrea Rinaldo. During my Ph.D I have spent almost one year @Princeton University working with Prof. I.R. Iturbe on the analysis and modelling of Virtual Water trade networks. Then I went back @University of Padova, where I did my post-doc working on ecological networks.

From April 2016, I'm assistant professor (RTDb) at the Physics and Astronomoy Department at the University of Padova, and I work in the [LiPh lab](http://liphlab.com/) in collaboration with Amos Maritan and Sandro Azaele.
