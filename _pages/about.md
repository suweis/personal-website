My name is Samir Suweis, I was born in Italy, from a Jordian father (Simon) and Italian mother (Alessandra). I grew up in Padova, and my passion for Physics and Matehamtics started during high school. I've decided to become a Physicist after I've read this [book](https://www.amazon.it/Solo-stupore-conosce-Lavventura-scientifica-ebook/dp/B008HRM9KW/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1535061995&sr=1-1&keywords=Solo+lo+stupore+conosce), collecting experiences, reflections and citations of the greatest scientists and physicists. I'm very eclectic, also loving phylosophy, neuroscience, art, ... in one word I'm a curios truth seeker.


I have obtained both Bachelor and Master degree in Theoretical Physics at the University of Padova. The final Master thesis consisted of a theoretical work on a subject at the boundary between statistical physics and ecological systems, performed under the guidance of prof. Amos Maritan. I then soon started a Ph.D in Environmental Engineering at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) under the supervision of prof. Andrea Rinaldo. The main goal of my Ph.D. research was to develop a theoretical framework for the study of the complex relation between hydrological mechanisms and the underlying ecological/biological patterns and processes, i.e. the field of ecohydrology. We have proposed a variety of new models, where the intrinsic complexity is not captured explicitly but rather described probabilistically. Statistical physics provided the crucial mathematical tools to attack these interdisciplinary problems. During my Ph.D I have spent almost one year @Princeton University working with Prof. I.R. Iturbe on the analysis and modelling of Virtual Water trade networks. Then I went back @University of Padova, where I did my post-doc working on ecological networks.

From April 2016, I'm assistant professor (RTDa) at the Physics and Astronomoy Department at the University of Padova, and I work in the [LiPh lab](http://liphlab.com/) in collaboration with Amos Maritan. Although I may say that my specialization is in not specializing, my main research themes can be classified in three broad areas: 
1) The formulation of simple principles to explain self-organization and emergent simplicity in nature; 
2) Data analysis and complex network modeling and non-linear dynamics in socio-ecological systems; 
3) Criticality in living systems, with a particular focus on brain criticality. 

My work focuses on research at the interface of ecology, hydrology and complex systems under an theoretical framework provided by statistical mechanics. It addresses a wide range of related topics, including ecosystem organizations, ecological networks, stochastic modelling of ecosystems dynamics and eco-hydrological processes, sustainability and ecosystems services, brain networks and whole brain models.   address the above and related topics from a comprehensive framework that include data mining, theoretical modeling (both computational and analytical) and statistical analysis.
