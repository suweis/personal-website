My name is Samir Suweis, I was born in Italy, from a Jordian father (Simon) and Italian mother (Alessandra).I am an assistant professor (RTDa) at the Physics and Astronomoy Department at the University of Padova, and I work in the [LiPh lab](http://liphlab.com/) in collaboration with Amos Maritan.  

My work focuses on research at the interface of ecology, hydrology and complex systems under an theoretical framework provided by statistical mechanics. It addresses a wide range of related topics, including ecosystem organizations, ecological networks, stochastic modelling of ecosystems dynamics and hydrological processes, sustainability and ecosystems services. In particular we look for any ubiquitous patterns or universal scaling behavior in real systems, that are signals of emergent order despite the variety and complexity of the systems involved. I address the above and related topics from a comprehensive framework that include data mining, theoretical modeling (both computational and analytical) and statistical analysis.
